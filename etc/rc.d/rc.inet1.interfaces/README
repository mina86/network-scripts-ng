You may put interfaces configuration files in this directory instead
of listing them in rc.inet1.conf.  Both options have their advantages
and disadvantages.  For instance, keeping files here may help in
syncing several machines configuration files.

Each file should have a name of an interface it keeps configuration
for.  Moreover, it must be executable or otherwise it won't be taken
into consideration when loading interfaces configuration -- this is so
that you can easily disable some interfaces.

As an example, you can have a  eth0  file with the following content:

    SUBSYSTEM=static
    IP=192.168.0.1
    NETMASK=255.255.255.128

Those files are sourced with first argument being either 'up' or
'down' depending whether the interface is about to be brought up or
down.
