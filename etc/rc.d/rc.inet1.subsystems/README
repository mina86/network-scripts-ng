This directory contains scripts which handle specific subsystems.
Those files are sourced by rc.inet1 if some interface is configured to
use this particular subsystem.

The first argument of sourced file is the interface name (for instance
eth0) and the second one is either 'up' for bringing interface up or
'down' for bringing interface down.

For subsystem to work it must be executable--this is so that you can
easily disable some subsystems.  Note, however, that some of the
subsystems refer to other subsystems and if that's the case the
subsystem file they are referring to does not need to be executable.

If you want do add your own subsystem we encourage you to prefix its
name with your initials and a hyphen, for instance 'js-foo'.  This way
you will avoid conflicts with possible future subsystems.

When developing your own subsystem note that everything that your
scripts writs to file descriptor number 2 (that is standard error
output) will be logged to syslog (if syslog is running and logger
available).

Moreover, try not to define too many variables and if you do prefix
their names with underscore and remember to unset them when they are
no longer used.  Several subsystems may be run in the same shell
process and altering environment too much may cause some of them to
malfunction.
